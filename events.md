## Where are the events?
Most of the events will be held in [Zoom](community.md).
You will need to sign up for a [ticket](tickets.md) to be able to get into the events.

## What will I need to access the events?
Different events will have different requirements - but for most just a phone, tablet or computer that can run Zoom will be enough.
You donâ€™t need a webcam or microphone for most events, but for others this will be useful. It will be clearly described on each event page.
