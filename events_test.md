IVFDF 2021 will have all the essential parts of the festival that you and we love, with some fab musicians and callers lined up to give you the full folky experience from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon.

For the main evening events we’re excited to have play for us:
* Contra with Nozzy
* Playford with Vicki Swan & Jonny Dyer, with calling from Andrew Swaine and Daisy Black
* Bal with Emily and the Simons
* Ceilidh with Jess and Richard Arrowsmith
* Techno Contra with the Bearded Dragons, with calling from Charlie Turner

Each of which will be accompanied by some amazing callers from around the UK.
Other events and more details will be released soon, as soon as they’ve finished incubating. Check back here or follow our FB page for announcements.

During the day we will be hosting a fantastic mix of workshops and sessions, we’re excited by the opportunity being online gives our workshop leaders to try out new things.
The traditional Saturday afternoon Display ceilidh will still be a highlight of the weekend and take us from current lockdown displays back through time to enjoy festivals past.

All this will round up with an incredible Survivors Ceilidh to finish on Sunday afternoon.

This year we have worked hard to think about bringing together a slightly different experience with the focus on what does work well on a screen. We would like everyone to find something that they will enjoy so watch this space, support our artists by buying a ticket, and prepare for a fun, folk filled weekend!

## Where are the events?
Most of the events will be held in [Zoom](community.md).
You will need to sign up for a [ticket](tickets.md) to be able to get into the events.

## What will I need to access the events?
Different events will have different requirements - but for most just a phone, tablet or computer that can run Zoom will be enough.
You don’t need a webcam or microphone for most events, but for others this will be useful. It will be clearly described on each event page.
