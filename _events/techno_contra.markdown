Charlie Turner has been dancing and teaching for as long as she can remember, but a move to California transformed her contra dancing and kick-started her calling career. Now based in Cambridge, UK, she still brings the best of the West Coast to contra crowds, with clear, friendly teaching and satisfying dance selections. She emphasises connection, fun, flow, and inclusivity in dance.

Vic Smith is a veteran folk musician and pioneer of Techno Contra and Techno Ceilidh in the UK. He can produce anything ranging from savage analog synthesizer beats to old-style traditional tones, always with a focus on danceability and excitement.
