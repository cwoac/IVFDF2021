Ever wanted to turn the sheet music of a folk dance tune into an ABC so that you can easily feed it into websites, tune book generators, midis, and other useful stuff? then this is the workshop for you, building from the very basics to you being able to do it for yourself in just a short space of time. ABC notation is incredibly popular for sharing tunes across the internet, and designed precisely for folk music!
