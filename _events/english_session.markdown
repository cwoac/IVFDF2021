This is IVFDF’s virtual Folk tune session! An opportunity to play and listen to Folk music in a relaxed environment, the virtual session has all the razzmatazz of a traditional pub session but none of the pub.
Come play your favourite tunes and chat with us on zoom.
So crack out your hurdy-gurdy’s, rosin up your bows, adjust your knitted waistcoats, and prepare for a folky time.
