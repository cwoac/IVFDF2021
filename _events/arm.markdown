IVFDF is run by a different folk society each year. This requires a bit of coordination which is where IVFDF central and the Annual Reps Meeting comes in.

## IVFDF Central
“IVFDF central” is a collection of people who do stuff to keep continuity between IVFDFs.
There are a number of roles: 

* **Archivist**: They who keeps track of the history of IVFDF
* **Treasurer**: Half the profits of each IVFDF go to IVFDF central to give loans to and underwrite future festivals, someone needs to look after said money. 
* **Development**: They help develop smaller folk societies around the country. 
* **Policies**: It turns out writing policies and keeping track of changes in the law isn’t in a student’s repertoire, so we have someone specific to help societies with them. 
* **Safeguarding**: Unfortunately, even at IVFDF we need a person in charge of keeping track of possible safeguarding problems across multiple years. 
* **Communications Officer**: External organisations get really confused when their contact changes every year, and also we need someone to organise telling societies things.

These IVFDF central members have no acting power, and everything they do is at the whim of the reps!  So who are the reps? The reps are people sent from each member society to the reps meeting to vote on various IVFDF matters, like how much money to loan future IVFDFs and who the IVFDF central members are, and various other important stuff. Each member folk society can nominate 2 people to get voting rights at reps meetings. Other people can turn up, but they can’t vote, IVFDF central members also can’t vote. All the decision power of IVFDF is in the hands of the member society nominees!

Have you got a folk society that wants to become a member with this news? Then just ensure there are at least 2 members of your folk society at 2 subsequent IVFDFs and then your society gets to be a member society!

## ARM Agenda

This year at the ARM we have 2 arising constitutional matters to vote on, as well as the usual business:

* Voting on who to run IVFDF in 2023
* Reports from this IVFDF, IVFDF 2020 and IVFDF 2022
* Reports from our IVFDF central members
* Other things and the usual excitement of AOBs!
