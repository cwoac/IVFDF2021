A workshop for those who want to try recording music and don’t know where to start! I’ll be teaching the fundamentals using the free recording software Audacity. After this workshop, you will be able to create music by yourself or with friends, create backing tracks to jam along with and more. All you need is a laptop! 

You can download Audacity for free from [https://www.audacityteam.org/download/](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/).
