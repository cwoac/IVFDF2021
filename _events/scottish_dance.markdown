Zs贸fi is originally from Budapest, Hungary, where she started Scottish Country Dancing in 2009. She did her teaching certificate in St Andrews in 2017. With Phill they form a great teacher-musician family and currently live in Low Valleyfield in Fife, Scotland.
After an adventurous trip around the world in 2017-2018, where Zs贸fi was teaching Scottish Dancing to children in Thailand, she was full with dreams and enthusiasm to start her own group. 2.5 years ago she formed the Bo'ness Dance group which is very inclusive, they even have a wheelchair dancer. Since the lockdown started the Online Bo'ness Dance group was formed having members all around the world from Uruguay to Croatia, approximately 7 different countries from 9 different time zones. 

Phill began playing accordion as a result of attending a SCD event aged 9 and has now played for Scottish Country Dancing for, well, ages.  As well as playing throughout the UK, Phill has played for SCD throughout Europe (meeting Zs贸fi on one of the trips) and as far afield as USA, Australia and New Zealand.  Now firmly settled in central Scotland, he plays regularly for online classes and, in normal times, plays for local class and regularly travels to play for dances and balls either solo or with a band.  Phill has played at IVFDF several times.
