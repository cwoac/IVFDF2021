In this workshop, we’ll explore the process of adapting and creating dances for solo/couple dancers. We’ll see the original choreography (if relevant), and then I’ll propose and call a solo/couple adaptation. After we dance, together we’ll talk about why the adaptation felt good, and suggest variations that feel even better! Genre-blurring is welcome; our starting point will be a blend of Playford-style and contra dances.
