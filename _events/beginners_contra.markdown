We have some visuals to help you understand what we're imagining while dancing at home. This is aimed at folks with 1-2 people dancing. If you have more, you can still join!  Clear a space, have water handy, and be prepared for moving (perhaps comfy dance or walking shoes). Put your computer/device where you can see and interact with the Zoom application. 

If you'd like to mute yourself and play along, I apologize I don't have sheet music to match the recorded tunes: 

1. After Midnight , by George Paul
2. Old Favorite,  by The Assembly 
3. Up South, Holloway, Sparkle of Starlight, by Stringrays
4. Flying Home to Shelley,  by Anadama
