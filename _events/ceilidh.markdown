We have 2 fantastic young callers in Erin Mansfield and Nancy Potts and amazing musicians in Richard and Jess Arrowsmith!

Erin's style is no-fuss clarity with enthusiasm and fun. She has a broad repertoire of dances from the British Isles and beyond which she calls at functions and festivals across the country. She is working closely with Nancy Potts, a child of English ceilidh musicians, Nancy's calling style bridges the gap between old and new-school calling. She is also an accomplished fiddle singer, ensuring that any ceilidh she calls is a true collaboration between caller and band.

Richard and Jess Arrowsmith usually play for ceilidhs with Hekety or with the Melrose Quintet while performing as a duo for concerts, but with lockdown in place they are delighted to bring you dancing tunes on melodeon and fiddle. You can expect their usual blend of fabulous melodies, counter melodies and accompaniments played with the expert lilt that makes the difference between music and dance music.
