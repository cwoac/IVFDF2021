Connection with a partner is at the heart of so much dance, but when dancing on-line it can easily be lost. 

This workshop looks at simple lead-follow exercises over Zoom, where the partners are at opposite ends of the internet, and explores whether remote connection is possible! 

Attendees will need to be able to hold their laptop / phone while dancing, this workshop will not work with static computers. Attendees will also need one connection per person - this workshop will not work for two people joining from the same room!
