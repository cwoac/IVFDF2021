Ever wondered what the hurdy gurdy is, why it sounds so distinctive, and why it plays tunes in such odd keys? This is the workshop for you! A demonstration, and a chance to play along with some traditional gurdy tunes in G major, C Major, DMinor and GMinor. Come and be a gurdy nerd!

You can download a tunebook [here](/assets/hurdy_gurdy_101_tunebook.pdf)

Playing along can be on any instrument (including rhythm instruments).

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsQO55Hodd6mFkQKKy6hm8tdAimL7qPGf) is a playlist to get inspired!

WARNING: the workshop will include rhythmic buzzing noises which some people may find overwhelming
