"Have you ever seen people dancing in hard-shoes and wondered how they do it? Fancied going to a workshop teaching an entire Clog/Appalachian/etc dance routine and want a few steps under your belt first? Tried rapper dancing and got the sword-handling down pat but still a bit clueless in the foot department?

Nickie will introduce you to the different sorts of sounds that hard shoes can make, covering some core steps and patterns found in various percussive dance styles (basically the things she wishes she knew as a mainly-self-taught baby step dancer). We'll look at different time signatures, making easy changes to a step to give it a different feel or rhythm, and some levels of detail you don't strictly need as a beginner but might be good to know for later.

If you can, please use a footwear/floor combination that will give you a comfortable amount of slip and allow you to hear what your feet are doing (any variety of hard-soled shoes, dance trainers, other smooth soled shoes you'd normally dance in, or socks on a hard floor should all be fine, but please be careful)."
