Emily Bowden and Simon Dumpleton perform together as a duo and as part of Anglo-Belgian Balfolk trio Emily & The Simons. Their music is centred around Emily's compositions, drawing inspiration from life's encounters and the energy of the dancefloor. From exquisite sensual mazurkas to joyful, driving bourr√©es, their music transports the imagination, stirs the feet and uplifts the spirit.
