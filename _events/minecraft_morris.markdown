Minecraft Morris - Meet us outside the blue pub in Minecraft town (the one with a honeypot sign by the pond), decked in your fanciest morris kit and prepared to wow the crowd with your best jig. Think Sidmouth Jig competition, crossed with Chippenham Stick and Bucket competition, crossed with Minecraft. Judged by our server moderators this is your chance to win some epic (in game) Minecraft goodies!

You will need a copy of Minecraft Java Edition for this.
