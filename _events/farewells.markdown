The Survivors Ceilidh has ended, itâ€™s time to head off but before you go remember to say goodbye to friends old and new. Gather for farewells in the Corridor. 

We have lots of social breakout rooms that are available throughout the festival. Please use these rooms whenever you want but be aware that these will not be stewarded.
