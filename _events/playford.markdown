Vicki Swan & Jonny Dyer recently changed jobs and moved into Cyber. They have worked tirelessly since the start of the pandemic performing all over the world giving concerts and dances. The car might only have had a couple of hundred miles put on the clock - but their internet mileage is massive. The only part of the house not being used for their virtual existence is the cupboard under the stairs where they huddle of an evening after the long walk back home from either Studio 1 or Studio 2. Their prior years of experience on the Playford, Contra and Ceilidh scenes has stood them in good stead for their transition to virtually playing in 2021. Jonny plays a range of instruments including cowhorn, harpsichord, carnyx and n√§verlur - none of which will be played at IVFDF. He will however play his accordion. Vicki plays nyckelharpa - the magical keyed fiddle from Sweden, as far as Vicki is concerned, no other instruments matter (there is the outside chance of flute, but probably not bagpipes).

Daisy and Andrew are callers based in Sheffield, where they run the popular dance and music session, Playford in the Pub. Daisy calls for ceilidhs as well as Playford, and has a lot of fun sneaking in a few older dances among the more modern ones. Andrew calls for most genres of
English country dancing, including ceilidh, American contra, Playford and modern country dances. Both enjoy making seventeenth century dances lively and accessible for new and more experienced dancers. Neither know what John Playford would think of a cyber Playford ball, but they suspect
that, as long as it annoyed Oliver Cromwell's Puritan lackeys, he'd have been cool with it.
