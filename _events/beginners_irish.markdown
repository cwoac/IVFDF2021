This workshop is aimed at the beginner dancer, Annette will teach a series of short solo hornpipe steps. Annette is a teacher of "Old Style Solo Irish Step Dancing", a percussive dance form and the precursor of competitive Irish dancing, steps are danced close to the floor. Annette lives and teaches in Ireland. The steps will be broken down into short movements and repeated, after which she will rebuild the steps, and finally join them into a short routine. In this workshop she expects to cover between 4 and 8 steps. Here is a clip to introduce the 1st step, created for a previous event: [http://bit.ly/StepWithAnnette006](http://bit.ly/StepWithAnnette006)
