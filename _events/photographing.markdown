Why do we dance? How does it make us feel? What memories of dancing stick with you the most? This workshop offers an opportunity to explore what folk dance means to us through photography. The workshop will combine discussion and analysis with some practical challenges. We will discuss our individual reactions to photos of dance events and dancers as well as looking at the technical and creative strategies that the photographers have used to capture their vision and evoke certain emotions. Participants will then be invited to plan and create their own images of what dance means to each of us.

A camera is useful though not necessary. Workshop activities will be designed to work for whatever equipment you have access to whether it be camera, camera phone, pen & paper, or just your imagination.
