Interested in synthesisers but don't know where to start? Want to learn more about what all the flashing lights mean? Or maybe you have bought a synth or some synth software and want to get more out of it. In this workshop I'll be giving an overview of how basic synthesis works as well as glimpses into some more advanced techniques. 

This will include a tutorial on starting with modular synthesis on your own computer using the free software VCV Rack. And you'd also be more than welcome to participate using your own hardware or other software. There will also be extensive time for questions on my own setup and for discussing your own gear and new things you could try with it. Attendance will be via Zoom. If you want to take part in learning with VCV rack, it would be most expedient for you to install it on your own system prior to the workshop starting.

You can download it from here: [https://vcvrack.com/Rack](https://vcvrack.com/Rack). If you wish to participate using your own hardware or software, then just have that ready to go. And if you just want to join in and watch or ask questions then just bring yourself.
