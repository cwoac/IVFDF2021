When you arrive at a social dance what can you expect? What on earth is a social folk dance? How can you blend in and persuade your fellow festival goers that you know what you're doing? Bob will give you a quick run down on ceilidh (both sorts), Playford, contra, Scottish Country and some other related styles (no, Running Set isn't and early morning folk exercise class!) so you know the key similarities and differences and are ready to dip your toe into any of them with style and poise.
