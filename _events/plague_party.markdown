We’ll be doing couple and circle dances from the fifteenth and sixteenth century and talking a bit about the challenges of interpreting the scant descriptions of them that have survived.  These are lovely dances, which work well in a small space, although you will need some room to move around.  (These early dances are all about control.)  If you’ve got a partner, great.  If you haven’t, don’t worry you’ll still be able to take part with a little imagination.  I’m planning to teach and demonstrate all dances will with live music although we are at the mercy of internet connections
