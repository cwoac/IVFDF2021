In this session we'll take a beginners look at playing the ukulele in open C, and show you how to take it further in your own time. Suitable for anyone comfortable with some basic ukulele chords, with 3 different levels of complexity for those wanting to take it further. We'll be using the American tune 'Where the Soul of Man Never Dies' as our introduction to the tuning.

You will need a Ukulele!
