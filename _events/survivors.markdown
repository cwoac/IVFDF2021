IVFDF's legendary survivors ceilidh will be slightly different this year. [Rhodri Davies](https://www.facebook.com/rhodri.davies.583) is going to be the host and "caller wrangler", running the sign up list and will be sorting out the sequence of live and recorded music and calls to bring you the standard dose of Chaotic Chaos.
