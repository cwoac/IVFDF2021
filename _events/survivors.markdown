The Survivors' Ceilidh at IVFDF was originally called that because it was for people who were still moving after an wild, almost non-stop weekend of dancing. This year it will have an additional meaning! We are still holding one this year and we are going to make it as near the original experience as we can manage in the circumstances.
To me the Survivors' Ceilidh means participation either as a dancer, a musician or a caller. I can't think of another major festival that does anything like this, let along in the finale spot. DIY in the extreme. A chance for people from different universities and generations and styles of dance to mingle together, to not take it too seriously and to have a good time.
Normally the event involces a sign-up sheet for who would like to call, negotiations with the band leader on what is possible and the quiet bit of organisation around the chaos to make sure there aren't 5 hornpipes in a row, that X gets a chance to call before their coach leaves and that there is a reasonable mix of old favourites and new dances and of dance styles. For quite a lot of people it will be their first chance to call with a live band and a LOT of dancers. A daunting prospect but a welcoming environment. But we also need to leven that with some more experienced callers as a safety net if needed. Above all it needs to be entertaining, whether you are calling, dancing or playing, or all three. And all live;  making use of the experience of the band leaders and organisers and the flexibility that gives us in a live situation then mixing that with the good-will and support of all concerned to make it a success. So a complex, chaotic mix.
We are going to try and bring elements of all that into the Survivor's Ceilidh this year. We will of course face added complications this year: the dances have to be suitable for people dancing on their own or in twos or threes. There won't be any large sets. Those of us that have been calling on-line have found that it is better to run dances a little shorter than we normally would. We also need to work with the limitations the technology places on us. Everything is going to be a little harder this year, so we are going to need to do a little more preparation in advance.
We certainly hope to have some live music and calls. I expect we will also have some recorded music and calls. In a live situation we have a band leader and some key musicians who are amplified and lots of others joining in on stage acoustically. This year, for each dance with live music we will have some key musicians broadcast and hopefully many others joining the virtual stage, just muted! We will have some old favourites. We will have multiple callers. We will have some callers from the calling workshop. We normally go into the weekend with a core of musicians and callers that we know will be available to take part so we can be confident that it will work, then make the rest up as we go along. That is where we stand now.

I've been given the job of "caller wrangler". I'm running the sign up list and will be sorting out the sequence. I'll be trying to provide the entertaining mix described above, the opportunity for new people to have a go, for long-time supporters of the festival to anchor the event, for us do dance some old favourites and above all for people to participate and have a good time. However, it is quite possible that not everyone who would like to take part will get the chance.

**Here is the request:** If you would like to call a dance or lead the music for a dance please get in touch with me. Message me [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/rhodri.davies.583), or contact me through the IVFDF committee I'll then get in touch with you to figure out what is possible and how we can put this all together. Spread the word.
