Step - more or less what you'd get if Scottish Country was danced solo, Ballet was danced to folk music, Highland dance got told to relax and enjoy life a bit more, and then all of that got combined into one dance style. It’s precise but not overly sharp, focusses on fancy(ish) footwork, and, um, looks Scottish. Everything will be taught from scratch, so no experience needed. This workshop doesn’t need a massive amount of space, but please be mindful of your surroundings. If you can, please wear flexible soft-soled shoes (socks, bare feet, or anything that will allow you to point your feet and won’t be too slippy or grippy on the floor you’ll be dancing on is fine).
