Pete Grassby has been playing Melodeon for song and dance for over 50 years, and has had a business dealing in, restoring and repairing Melodeons, Accordions and Concertinas for 33 years.
This workshop is for beginners, who will need a G/D tuned Melodeon and a zoom screen. Some notes will be sent out during the week before for those who want something to look at after the workshop has finished. You should be able to play a couple of simple tunes by the end, and you are welcome to follow up with me afterwards. I have instruments in stock.
