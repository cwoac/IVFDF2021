Scottish country dancing is a team sport. Ideally, in normal circumstances, you need a partner and several other couples to make up a set. So doing it by yourself, with a bunch of imaginary friends, can be quite challenging. So I would recommend that you only attempt this if you have some prior experience of Scottish country dancing as otherwise it will just be too confusing. 

We'll cover some steps and formations and a dance or two (depending on time). You'll need soft shoes, a clear space if possible, and plenty of imagination!
