Join us for (probably) the world’s first Minecraft ceilidh! Charlotte Rich-Griffin will guide you through a few dances of different styles including ceilidh and Playford. If we’re feeling really ambitious we might even try a contra! 

In order to join this workshop, you already need to be familiar with Minecraft and the IVFDF server as we will not be able to provide specific tech support during this workshop. There are plenty of people to help you get familiar with the server beforehand. You also need to be comfortable moving around, jumping and crouching, preferably to a beat!
