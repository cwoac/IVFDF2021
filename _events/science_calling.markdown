Bob's day job is as a science teacher and he's been doing some reading. Possibly one of the most important theories in teaching centers around cognitive load which helps us understand what makes some things more difficult to learn, how we can increase our chances and why less is usually more. Bob will give you a brief run down of the key ideas and some thoughts on how this could affect our thinking about workshops and calling.
