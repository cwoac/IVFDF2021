Nozzy are a high-energy lively contra duo from the UK. With Ozzy on piano, and Nikki on fiddle and flute, they take music from pretty much anywhere and set it to a fun and danceable beat.

Meanwhile Charlotte Rich-Griffin is an enthusiastic contra and ceilidh caller based in Oxfordshire. She is also IVFDF central's communication officer which means she has to say hello to everyone at IVFDF. Hello!
