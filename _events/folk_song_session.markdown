I can't teach you any fancy singing things or educate you about songs, but I can host an anything-goes, come-as-you-are song 
session, encourage you and try to maintain a good atmosphere, provide lyrics for people who don't have songs memorised or can't 
think of songs. I hope people will have a fun social time singing songs they enjoy and perhaps hearing some new ones from each 
other.
