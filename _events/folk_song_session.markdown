Folk song session (done as a singaround) -- I can't teach any fancy singing things or educate people about songs, but I can host an anything-goes, come-as-you-are song session, encourage participants and try to maintain a good atmosphere, provide lyrics for people who don't have songs memorised or can't think of songs, and troubleshoot basic zoom things like turning on original sound. I hope people would have a fun social time singing songs they enjoy and perhaps hearing some new ones from each other.

No limit on number of participants. I've been to good online song sessions with anywhere from 6 to 30 people, and more would be manageable. With more people then not everyone would get to sing, but probably not everyone would want to do so anyway -- and limiting the number of participants doesn't solve "not everyone gets to sing" at all!
