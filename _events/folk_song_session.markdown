I canâ€™t teach you any fancy singing things or educate you about songs, but I can host an anything-goes, come-as-you-are song session for us all to enjoy.  I'll provide a few lyrics for songs you might know in case you can't think of any, but you are warmly invited to bring and sing any folk songs you please.  It'll be great if we can all pick up new songs from each other.

This will be a singaround rather than an all-together session: one person/household sings while everyone else is muted (but you can sing along on mute in your own home if you wish!), and we take turns and appreciate everyone.  Enthusiasm is more important than skill!
