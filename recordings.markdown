Thanks to the fact that everything is being done over technology this year, we are excited to be able to offer you the ability to see some recordings from the event.

'IVFDF Through the Ages' will be uploaded later as we need to have the participants removed, but we already have for you now Bob Morgan's [Bluffer's Guide to social folk dancing](https://youtu.be/oK7nRbTS1AA).
