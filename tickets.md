<h1><a href="https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/groups/bristol-university-folk-society/events/ivfdf-online">Buy your tickets here!</a></h1>
<h2>IMPORTANT! Sending you your ticket is a *manual* process and will *not* be immediate. Do not fear, we will be sending out tickets at regular intervals up to and during the event.</h2>
* You will get a 'payment recieved' from the SU with very few details on it.
* You will then get an email direct from ivfdf2021 at somepoint in the next 24 hours with links to the discord and minecraft.
* The zoom invite will be emailed Friday.
* Check your spam for both - we've been having problems reported to us on that.

## What does a ticket get you?

All the things! Well, all the things that we’re offering which includes live music concerts with dance callers, a range of workshops, session spaces, and Discord and Minecraft community spaces. As all of this will be online you will need to have a ticket to be able to access the event links. We’ll send these out as an email to the address you provide when booking. The price of the ticket is variable and we ask that you pay what you can afford.

## What are the different prices?

* Unwaged: £1 -  We know life is difficult right now and not everyone is feeling financially secure. We would really like to see you take part and that is the most important thing. This tier is the most economic way of getting involved in the festival.
* Standard £10 - This will cover all of IVFDF’s costs and give a conservative donation to the artists involved.
* Supporters £25 - You’re feeling generous and can afford to give a little more to our artists. This will give a larger donation to all the artists involved.

## What happens if I’d like to give a different amount?

Thank you! You can donate through this link:

<h1><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=JP5YGAQQZN9CW">Donate!</a></h1>

The link is available now and throughout the weekend. We will happily accept additional amounts through there. 

*Important*: You still need to buy a ticket from the link above, so if (for instance) you wanted to give us £15 total, please buy a £10 ticket and donate £5.

## Sponsors
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/ad_sifd.png" alt="SIFD logo" height=50 width=50 />
IVFDF 2021 is brought to you with the support of [SIFD - the Society for International Folk Dancing](https://www.sifd.org).

## I only want to come to one event, is there a day ticket or something?

No, but what you can do is buy a £1 ticket and add a donation to make it up to something appropriate, say £4 for a total of £5. 

## Is there any other way to get a ticket?
Even an online IVFDF needs stewards and other volunteers, and as usual we will be offering free tickets to those who help out. See the [getting involved]({{site.baseurl}}/get_involved/) for how you can help out.

## Where exactly is the money going?

There is a small amount of core expenditure for us with Zoom, Website hosting, Paypal fees. All other profits will be given to the artists. Some artists have generously volunteered their time for which we are very grateful.
