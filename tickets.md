# Tickets 

*Buy your ticket link*

## What does a ticket get you?

All the things! Well, all the things that we’re offering which includes live music concerts with dance callers, a range of workshops, session spaces, and Discord and Minecraft community spaces. As all of this will be online you will need to have a ticket to be able to access the event links. We’ll send these out as an email to the address you provide when booking. The price of the ticket is variable and we ask that you pay what you can afford.

## What are the different prices?

* Unwaged: £1 -  We know life is difficult right now and not everyone is feeling financially secure. We would really like to see you take part and that is the most important thing. This tier is the most economic way of getting involved in the festival.
* Standard £10 - This will cover all of IVFDF’s costs and give a conservative donation to the artists involved.
* Supporters £25 - You’re feeling generous and can afford to give a little more to our artists. This will give a larger donation to all the artists involved.

## What happens if I’d like to give a different amount?

Thank you! There is a donation button <link> available now and throughout the weekend. We will happily accept additional amounts through there.

## Where exactly is the money going?

There is a small amount of core expenditure for us with Zoom, Website hosting, Paypal fees. All other profits will be given to the artists. Some artists have generously volunteered their time for which we are very grateful.
