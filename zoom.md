# About

## What is zoom?
For those people who have been under a rock for the last new months - [Zoom](https://zoom.us) is a video conferencing software. It allows lots of people to join an event and be able to see each other.

## Which Version do I need?
At a bare minimum, you will need version 5.3.0 or later. Versions of Zoom earlier than that will not allow you the freedom to move yourself between event rooms. *Important* There is currently a known issue with chromebooks which means they *will not work*. If zoom pushes out a fix before the festival, we will update accordingly.

# Using Big Zoom

## What is Big Zoom?
This is what IVFDF 2021 is calling a single zoom meeting with multiple breakout rooms. The entire event will be in one Zoom meeting with each individual event in a breakout room. This will give the feel on one large festival, with moving between rooms being faster than galloping to the bottom of a set.

## What are the breakout rooms?

These are smaller rooms inside the main meeting. We’ve created rooms that are performance, social and sound check rooms.

## Zoom etiquette

During events please keep your microphone muted unless you are actively cheering or communicating when invited too.
This keeps background noise down for other users and helps keep the audio quality up.

## Pinning a screen

You can choose one screen to be largest on your screen. This is useful for seeing the performers screen or dancing with someone else. This is how you do it: <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362743">https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362743</a>
