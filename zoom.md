# About

## What is zoom?
For those people who have been under a rock for the last new months - [Zoom](https://zoom.us) is a video conferencing software. It allows lots of people to join an event and be able to see each other.

## Which Version do I need?
At a bare minimum, you will need version 5.3.0 or later. Versions of Zoom earlier than that will not allow you the freedom to move yourself between event rooms. *Important* There is currently a known issue with chromebooks which means they *will not work*. If zoom pushes out a fix before the festival, we will update accordingly.

# Using Big Zoom

## What is Big Zoom?
This is what IVFDF 2021 is calling a single zoom meeting with multiple breakout rooms. The entire event will be in one Zoom meeting with each individual event in a breakout room. This will give the feel on one large festival, with moving between rooms being faster than galloping to the bottom of a set.

## What are the breakout rooms?

These are smaller rooms inside the main meeting. We’ve created rooms that are performance, social and sound check rooms.

Just like in real life, some will have scheduled dances or workshops in them. When they are not in use, feel free to hang around, just like an IVFDF in the physical world.

The social spaces are great for those catch-ups that usually take place in the corridors.

## What should I expect when I join?
When you first arrive, you will appear in the **Main session**. It will just look like any other zoom meeting. There will be a steward to welcome you, and some information telling you what things are on where.

You will need to **join a breakout room** to get into any of the events or social rooms.

Feel free to hang out in the main session and chat to the stewards

## How do I Join a **Breakout room**?
Check out this link for [https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005769646-Participating-in-breakout-rooms](full info)

* Click ‘breakout rooms’ at the bottom of the screen. It might be hidden, so click the three dots if you don’t see it.
  ![Image of breakout button](/assets/zoom_2.png)
  ![Image of breakout button](/assets/zoom_3.png)
* A pop up will appear with all the rooms. Select the room you’d like to join.
  ![Image of breakout rooms](/assets/zoom_1.png)
  If you can only see the top room, and then a long list of people, toggle the little drop down to the left of the breakout room. This will collapse the list and allow you to see the rooms.
  ![Image of breakout rooms](/assets/zoom_4.png)

## How do I change **breakout room**?
Just click the breakout rooms button again and select a different room

## How do I get back to the **Main Session**?
The **Main Session** does not appear on the breakout room list. To get back to the **Main Session**, you will need to leave the breakout room.

Head for where you would normally see the Leave Meeting button. It will be blue and read **Leave Breakout Room**.

## Help I can’t see the Breakout room button?
Some platforms, (IOS, chromebooks) or versions of zoom can’t see the buttons.

1. [Update Zoom](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZnxPsxYc2Q9mYbTC_02kE4Wc25UcElhh_6lcrO-rbGk/edit)
2. Check the requirements on [this list](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005769646-Participating-in-breakout-rooms), if your device isn’t listed it may be that you can’t self-select.
3. If 2 makes no sense, talk to the host in the **Main Session**.
4. Talk to the Host or co-host in the **Main Session** and they will check whether they can move you through their settings.
5. If the steward can move you, they will put you where you want to go. You will need to click OK on the popup after they have moved you. For all other ‘moves’ you will need to either return to the **Main Session** or message/chat to a co-host to move you to the next room.
 
If we cannot sort you out, you will be entitled to a full refund, or you can check on a different device.

# Tips and Tricks
## Before IVFDF
1. [Update Zoom](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZnxPsxYc2Q9mYbTC_02kE4Wc25UcElhh_6lcrO-rbGk/edit) (and keep it up to date - this really makes a difference).
2. Check the requirements of the workshops you want to attend. Some are specifically designed for phones/tablets or computers, not both.
3. When you join the meeting, you will be asked if you’d like the host to unmute you. If you allow this, IVFDF will automatically unmute you for applause at the end of dance or at the end of a workshop etc. It’s totally up to you, and you can change your mind whilst in the meeting.

## Whilst at IVFDF
* You will enter the Main session unmuted unless you have selected something else.
* Different breakout rooms will have different mute settings turning on, so you will sometimes enter them muted or unmuted.
* Breakouts can be glitchy. Sometimes you can’t enter/leave a room, get kicked out of a room or meeting, or can’t be moved by a co-host. Try these: 
  1. Try moving again.
  2. Try leaving meeting, restarting device and updating Zoom app, wait 3 minutes & re-join  meeting.
* If you are struggling to see a demo by a workshop leader or performer, try swapping the view setting at the top of the screen. **Speaker view** will make the person inputting the sound larger.
   ![Image of speaker view](/assets/zoom_8.png)
* Alternatively [pin](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000505583-Pin-or-Spotlight-Video) a video to make it larger.
  You can choose one screen to be largest on your screen. This is useful for seeing the performers screen or dancing with someone else. This is how you do it: <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362743">https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362743</a>
  Even better - go to Sally’s "Pin to Win" Workshop!
  
## Zoom etiquette

During events please keep your microphone muted unless you are actively cheering or communicating when invited too.
This keeps background noise down for other users and helps keep the audio quality up.
