We know lots of you love an IVFDF t-shirt and look forward to adding one to your collection each year. Today we're launching this year's designs and you can get some for yourself in our [merch store](https://ivfdf2021.teemill.com/)

We've made all our T's, hoodies, and other items as affordable as possible while also maintaining strong ethical and sustainability standards, which are really important to us. You can find out more about the sustainability of our merch [here](https://teemill.com/the-journey/) Where we can, these items are provided at cost to you but some come with a minimal profit built in. All profits from the festival will be be split between the artists.
