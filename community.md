Unsurprisingly, we are going to be a lot more reliant on technology than previous years of IVFDF. Here's a rundown on what we are going to be using.

# Zoom

Zoom is our meeting app of choice as probably the most widely known and used. More information on it and how we are using it is [here]({{site.baseurl}}/community/zoom/).

# Discord

Discord is a persistent chat system, somewhere between a forum and irc (for those who know of such things). You can access it via app or through your browser. More details [here]({{site.baseurl}}/community/discord/)

# Minecraft

A 3D sandbox you can explore, build and ... Morris dance in? More details on this coming shortly!
