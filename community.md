The IVFDF community is a big part of what makes the festival so special.
We know that this year the usual spaces that would exist are not an option and that we are going to be a lot more reliant on technology than usual.
We hope you’ll take part in the community spaces we have set up for you.
Alongside all our events we’ll have a dedicated Discord server and Minecraft world available throughout the weekend for ticket holders to socialise in.


Here is a summary of the platforms we are using to host IVFDF, along with help for those who are unfamiliar with them.

# Zoom

Zoom is our meeting app of choice as probably the most widely known and used. More information on it and how we are using it is [here]({{site.baseurl}}/community/zoom/).

# Discord

Discord is a persistent chat system, somewhere between a forum and irc (for those who know of such things). You can access it via app or through your browser. More details [here]({{site.baseurl}}/community/discord/)

# Minecraft

A 3D sandbox you can explore, build and ... Morris dance in? More details on this coming shortly!
