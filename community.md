# Zoom

## What is zoom?
For those people who have been under a rock for the last new months - Zoom is a video conference software. It allows lots of people to join an event and be able to see each other.

## Which Version do I need?
At a bare minimum, you will need version 5.3.0 or later (5.0.0 for Chromebook). Versions of Zoom earlier than that will not allow you the freedom to move yourself between event rooms.

## Zoom etiquette

During events please keep your microphone muted unless you are actively cheering or communicating when invited too.
This keeps background noise down for other users and helps keep the audio quality up.

## Pinning a screen

You can choose one screen to be largest on your screen. This is useful for seeing the performers screen or dancing with someone else. This is how you do it: https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362743
Even better - go to Sally’s Workshop! <link to ‘Pin to Win’ Workshop>

# Discord
## What is Discord?
Discord is an application/website which allows users to create their own space, or “Server”, to share information and communication in real time. It’s an online chat room specially built for IVFDF. It has options to write, talk over voice, screen share all in individual areas, or “channels”, for specific topics.

## Why should I join?
Folk festivals are heavily based on the community aspect. The Discord allows some parts of this to take place in a digital way as we can’t be together in person this year. 

There are various areas for all types of interests and groups to share as well as the option to individually message and catch up with people you may not have seen all year and have been looking at a way to get in touch since IVFDF2020. 

## Why not just use Facebook?

Not everyone is on Facebook. Discord allows everyone to join in.

Discord is more private than Facebook. The things written will only be seen by other people on the server, not the whole world. We can’t screen everyone joining the Discord server, but it’s more sheltered from the whole world than facebook.

Better Organisation in Discord. The ability to have different Channels about different topics allows people to chat without things being lost in a big stream of things.

We’ll still be chatting on facebook too. Think of Facebook and the Website as the notice boards, but Discord as the conversations that happen in the corridors and stairwells.

## How is this different to the chat function in Zoom?

The chat function is great, and will be used for the individual events. However it disappears at the end of each event so you can’t access things afterwards. It also moves very quickly as everything is in one thread. Discord allows us to have a communication place that spans the whole weekend.

## Ok - You’ve convinced me. How do I get Access?

On a computer - click the link provided in your booking email. This will take you to the website to sign up for an account, or access the server if you already have a Discord account.

https://discord.com/download will allow you to download to your computer/phone/tablet or you can go to your app store on your phone. This isn’t a requirement though, browser is fine.

You will need to create an account to use the server along with verifying your email address which is done as part of the installation process.
